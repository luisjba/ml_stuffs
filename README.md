# Machine Learning Utilities
This repositority is intended for share python code used for Machine Learning.

### Install dependency libraries
This funtions works with the following libraries.
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pytorch

NumPy
```
pip install numpy
```
Scikit-learn
```
pip install scikit-learn
```
For Pytorch you can use one of the following two commands, depending on your Python version. To install via conda and other extra libraries you con go to the [oficial Pytorch site](https://pytorch.org).
```
# Python 3.x
pip3 install torch
# Python 2.x
